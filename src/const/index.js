        title: "Belém Tower in Lisbon",
        description: `Belém Tower (Portuguese: Torre de Belém, officially 
            the Tower of Saint Vincent (Portuguese: Torre de São Vicente) 
            is a 16th century fortification located in Lisbon that served 
            both as a fortress and as a ceremonial gateway to Lisbon. It 
            was built during the height of the Portuguese Renaissance, 
            and is a prominent example of the Portuguese Manueline style,
            but it also incorporates hints of other architectural styles.
            The structure was built from lioz limestone and is composed of 
            a bastion and a 30-metre (98.4 ft),[4] four-storey tower.
            Since 1983, the tower has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
            along with the Jerónimos Monastery. It is often portrayed as 
            a symbol of Europe's Age of Discoveries[1] and as a metonym 
            for Portugal or Lisbon, given its landmark status. It has 
            incorrectly been stated that the tower was built in the middle 
            of the Tagus and now sits near the shore because the river was 
            redirected after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. In fact, the tower 
            was built on a small island in the Tagus river near the Lisbon 
            shore.`,

        description: `The "Town Musicians of Bremen" (German: Die Bremer 
            Stadtmusikanten) is a popular fairy tale retrieved and recorded 
            by the Brothers Grimm. It was first published in Grimms' Fairy 
            Tales in 1819. It tells the story of four aging domestic animals, 
            who after a lifetime of hard work are neglected and mistreated 
            by their former masters. Eventually, they decide to run away and 
            become town musicians in the city of Bremen. Contrary to the 
            story's title the characters never arrive in Bremen, as they 
            succeed in tricking and scaring off a band of robbers, capturing 
            their spoils, and moving into their house. According to the 
            Aarne–Thompson classification system, the story qualifies as 
            a Type 130 folktale ("Outcast animals find a new home").`,

        structurally completed by 1436, with the dome designed by Filippo 
        Brunelleschi. The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome 
        marble panels in various shades of green and pink, bordered by white, 
        and has an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival façade by Emilio De 
        Fabris.

        and Giotto's Campanile. These three buildings are part of the UNESCO 
        World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are

        the largest brick dome ever constructed.

        the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the 
        Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its nearly four-degree 
        lean, the result of an unstable foundation. The tower is situated 
        behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the 
        city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and 
        the Pisa Baptistry.
        The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, due 
        to soft ground on one side, which was unable to properly support the 
        structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the 
        structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased 
        until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) 
        by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.`,

        simply St. Peter's Basilica, is an Italian Renaissance church in 
        Vatican City, the papal enclave within the city of Rome.
        Designed principally by Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, Carlo Maderno 
        and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, St. Peter's is the most renowned work of 
        Renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world. While 
        it is neither the mother church of the Catholic Church nor the 
        cathedral of the Diocese of Rome, St. Peter's is regarded as one of 
        the holiest Catholic shrines. It has been described as "holding a 
        unique position in the Christian world"[4] and as "the greatest of 
        all churches of Christendom".
        Catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of 
        Saint Peter, chief among Jesus's apostles and also the first Bishop 
        of Rome (Pope). Saint Peter's tomb is supposedly directly below the 
        high altar of the basilica. For this reason, many popes have been 
        interred at St. Peter's since the Early Christian period, and there 
        has been a church on this site since the time of the Roman emperor 
        Constantine the Great.`,

        the Salute, is a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located 
        at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of 
        Venice, Italy.
        It stands on the narrow finger of Punta della Dogana, between the 
        Grand Canal and the Giudecca Canal, at the Bacino di San Marco, 
        making the church visible when entering the Piazza San Marco from 
        the water. The Salute is part of the parish of the Gesuati and is 
        the most recent of the so-called plague churches.
        In 1630, Venice experienced an unusually devastating outbreak of 
        the plague. As a votive offering for the city's deliverance from the 
        pestilence, the Republic of Venice vowed to build and dedicate a 
        church to Our Lady of Health (or of Deliverance, Italian: Salute). 
        The church was designed in the then fashionable baroque style by 
        Baldassare Longhena, who studied under the architect Vincenzo Scamozzi. 
        Construction began in 1631. Most of the objects of art housed in the 
        church bear references to the Black Death.`,
